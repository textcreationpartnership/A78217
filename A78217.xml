            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:114076:6"/> (as charity binds me to believe) have proceeded according to that light they have received, but only to hold forth in a briefe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, according as it hath been deſired, what the <hi>true viſible Church-ſtate is, of Chriſts appointment under the New Teſtament,</hi> and how proper it is to him only to inſtitute it, &amp; what neceſsity lyes upon all thoſe that profeſſe the doctrine of the Goſpell to embrace it, and ſubmit unto it, and to come off from all other Church ſtates that are of humane conſtitution, <hi>(as I underſtand a Nationall politicall Church-ſtate to be)</hi> if we will expect <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to dwell amongſt us, and take pleaſure in us for the future.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Another end propoſed to my ſelfe in compoſing this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, was not to diſcover or lay open before the world, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of any of my brethren, that either walke contrary to the rule of the word, and beſides it, in the matters of worſhip, or that through the wiles of Sathan, &amp; cunning craftines of men, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Epheſ. 4.13.</hi> have been carried away from their former ſtedfaſtnes in the uſe of thoſe pure Goſpell ordinances and inſtitutions, and now live and walke up and downe the world, as if Jeſus Chriſt were Church-leſſe, &amp; the Saints Chriſt-leſſe; yea, as if the barrel of Chriſts Meale, and Cruſe of his Oyle, (lockt up in his ſpirituall ordinances and adminiſtrations,) were altogether drawn dry and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: but that I might be a poore inſtrument in the hands of Chriſt to deliver ſuch from their falſe wayes, that are yet in <hi>Egyptian darknes,</hi> &amp; reduce thoſe to the <hi>Tents of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi> that are gone from them; where they may again (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) enjoy their beloved,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.7.8.</note> and be built up to a further enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>(beloved in the Lord)</hi> you have a briefe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of what I have propounded to my ſelfe, touching the method, grounds and ends of this Treatiſe. I have only a few
<pb facs="tcp:114076:6"/> things to requeſt at your hands, and then I ſhall diſmiſſe you to the Treatiſe it ſelfe, and commend both it and you to the bleſsing of Chriſt. Now that which I have to requeſt of you is this.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That you would not receive with the left hand, what is offered to you with the right, but endeavour to put a candid and faire conſtruction (as in charity you are bound) on the weak endeavours of him, that had nothing in his eye, but Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and your and the whole Kingdomes welfare.</p>

Before his death, as <hi>Math.</hi> 16 18, 19. <hi>And I ſay unto thee, that thou art Peter, &amp; upon this rock will I build my Church &amp; the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it: and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdome of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> Now this muſt be underſtood of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> and order we are ſpeaking to, which the Saints enjoy here on earth; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not give any power to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to bind in the world, for the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.36. But by binding and looſing on earth, muſt needs be underſtood the executing of the cenſures and ordinances of the viſible Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on earth, which is diſtinct from that Kingdome of glory in heaven.</p>
               <p>So that of <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17, 18. <hi>And if he ſhall neglect to heare them, tell it to the Church: But if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen, and a Publican: Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> Which place, though there be ſome difference between the <hi>Claſſicall</hi> and <hi>Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> Divines, whether by <hi>Die Eccleſiae,</hi> be meant the <hi>claſſicall Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114076:14"/> or the <hi>Congregationall,</hi> yet they both, and all of all ſorts agree in this, that it is meant of the viſible Church-ſtate under the New Teſtament; which is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficient for us in this place to have granted, becauſe it anſwers the end for which it is alleadged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After <hi>Chriſts</hi> reſurrection, when he had made a glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all the powers of darknes, and as the true <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the mighty one, had carried away the gates, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the powers of death and hell on his ſhoulders, then (by his own mouth) he declares this truth, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18.19.20. <hi>And Ieſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: and ſo I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.</hi> This is ſo plain to the buſines in hand, that there needs no explaining of it. And that of <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. ſpeaking to them of the <hi>things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we come to what we find delivered by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom he gave order, to ſee his Will, in this, as well as other things fulfilled, and whom he qualified in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, for the very purpoſe, that it might be put into execution.</p>
               <p>Now the Scriptures that hold this forth from the Apoſtles, may be referred to two heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To their own practiſe.</item>

                  <item>2. Partly that he might prevent their ſeducing, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.4, 18, 19. and ſo much for Scripture.</item>

               <p n="2">2. What now is, not only in this Kingdome, but in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other reformed Churches abroad in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſhall be, and cannot be farre of, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be called, and the fullnes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> brought in, which the Scriptures ſpeake out abundantly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For reaſon and Argument to cleare this point, I ſhall referre all to theſe ſix heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is agreeable to the Law of nature and nations: for we find by experience, that there is ſcarce in the whole world any Nation, whether <hi>Turks, Indians, Romans,</hi> but they have ſtill had their externall and viſible order of worſhip and government, they have their Temples, Prieſts, Lawes, Ordinances, Sacrifices, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which they viſibly obſerve, and conforme themſelves to the obſervation of. Now doubtleſſe <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is not behind hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in his Church and Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is no other then is ſuitable to the practiſe of the Church of God, in all ages, and conditions before the comming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In Paradiſe, before the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> there were two ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall trees, the tree of <hi>life,</hi> and the tree of <hi>knowledge</hi> of good and evill: which were not ſimple trees, but trees ſet a part by Gods
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114076:15"/> appointment, and divine inſtitution; as water in Baptiſme, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After the fall, before the Law was given, while the Church of God was in Families, then they had externall worſhip, ſacrifices, Prieſthood, firſt borne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Law was given, in the wildernes, there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall forme of worſhip and Ordinances ſuteable to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a moving Tabernacle, &amp;c. and after the Iſraelites came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was a fixed Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and a compleate forme of Worſhip in externals, that God had preſcribed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after revealed to <hi>David</hi> by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11.12.19. Anſwerable to which, (though in another kind) <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath laid downe, and given out to his Saints, a platforme of Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der under the Goſpell, as the Apoſtle holds forth plainly, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. where he ſhewes that the old Law, will not ſerve a new order, but we muſt have a new one, and he proves tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are met together in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For Chriſt is not only a Prieſt, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> but a law-giver, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he did both their works; a high Prieſt to ſucceed <hi>Aaron,</hi> and an Apoſtle to ſucceed <hi>Moſes:</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. Chriſt is <hi>Aaron</hi> in point of offering up ſacrifice, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> in point of preſcribing lawes, for holy worſhip. With many other places.</p>

                  </gap>zement of men and Angels.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is neceſſary in reſpect of the Saints fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together in the worſhip and ſervice of God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the exerciſe of their graces, which cannot ſo well, nor ſo conveniently, and with that advantage to one another be performed, as in this order, as the Apoſtle holds forth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>per totum.</hi> For as it is in Civill ſociety or Politie, ſo it is in Eccleſiaſticall. Now in Civill Government, that Politicall vertue that is in a man, cannot be ſo wel exerciſed and managed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed multitude alone by himſelfe, as in a ſociety: So here, theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114076:16"/> gifts and graces which Chriſt hath beſtowed by his Spirit on the Saints, cannot be ſo well exerciſed ſingly by themſelves alone, as when they are united together into a Church ſtate and order, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of their enjoying the ordinances, for its worth our ſerious knowledge and obſervation, that the ordinances of Chriſt are not due to Chriſtians meerly as Chriſtians or Beleevers, but to Beleevers as in a Church State, for a Beleever is to come under a double conſideration, as a man is. Now a man is conſidered two wayes, either as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, as he is rationall, or politicall, that is, as he is a man by himſelfe, or as he is joyned to ſome ſociety, or Corporation: So a believer is to be lookt upon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a believer, or member of Chriſt ſingly by himſelfe, or as a member of ſome viſible Church of Chriſt: and in this latter ſence only is he capable of enjoying fellowſhip with Chriſt in his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ordinances and worſhip. The reaſon is this, becauſe the ſame Chriſt, that inwardly unites him by the Spirit, and faith to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, doth outwardly alſo call him to his body, the Church, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſerve him in the uſe of his Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of thoſe many ſingular helps, and encouragements that in this Church-ſtate they enjoy, as I ſhall hereafter in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſhew: Which without it they are deprived of; for a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be ſo happy alone, as he is in company, eſpecially when that ſociety proves a helpe, not a hinderance to him, as this doth we now ſpeake of: We find that in the very ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, God ſaw, that it was not beſt for <hi>Adam</hi> to be alone; now if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety were good for man in a perfect ſtate, how much more then in an unperfect ſtate, as the Saints are now in, whiles they are here below, and abſent from the Lord? And the truth of this is further evident from the many enemies the Saints meet with in their walking with God, where they have all the powers of darknes ſet againſt them. Now union together in this Church-ſtate, is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular remedy againſt thoſe temptations they thus meet withall; we know by experience, that company in travelling makes the way both ſweeter and ſafer, whereas travelling alone ſingly by a mans ſelf, is not only the more tedious, but dangerous: ſo here: and therefore without all controverſie, this condition of the Saints in this way of the Goſpell was foreſeen of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as moſt neceſſary and uſefull.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114076:16"/>6. If we looke to the Ordinances of Chriſt, we ſhall find the truth of this particular very cleare; the reaſon is, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well ſubſiſt but in this Church-ſtate and order, eſpecially ſince the Apoſtles times, as I ſhall ſpeake more fully to, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The office of a Paſtor, how can it be executed but in this Church-ſtate and order? A Shepherd we know cannot be a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, but to a flock, nor a ſteward be a ſteward but to a family: So here to be a Miniſter in office requires a particular ſociety of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to which he muſt ſtand in relation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The adminiſtration of the ſeales, how can they take place, where there is no Church-ſtate? I am not of their mind that ſay they are ordained to make believers, but rather to confirme and build up thoſe that are believers, when they are brought into Church-fellowſhip, as we find in the Primitive Churches. The word is to plant Churches, and the Seales to build and ſtabliſh them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The cenſures, which are the Keys of Chriſts Kingdome; we know they reach not any till they be in a Church-ſtate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. for by being without, there, is properly meant of a viſible Church-ſtate. And ſo much for the firſt branch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place we come to the proof of the 2. branch of the former Propoſition, which is this. <hi>That this ſacred viſible Church ſtate, order, and politie, under the New Teſtament, is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed by Ieſus Chriſt, and him only.</hi> No created power in heaven or earth is exalted to this dignity beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor hath a hand with him in it.</p>
               <p>Now this I ſhall endeavour, (being a truth of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, eſpecially at this time) to make out fully.</p>

Now how fully is this errour confuted by the truth that hath beene formerly laid down. For if Chriſt hath inſtituted (as

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe without this, there cannot be that beauty ſhining forth in the Saints and Ordinances, for what are a company of choiſe materials which are fit for a building, ſo long as they lie looſe one from another? Tis with the Saints united, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſpeake of the <hi>Via lactea,</hi> or milky way in the heavens, they yeeld forth a glorious luſtre, and precious light, above what they are ſingle by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe without this, the Saints loſe not their beauty onely, but their ſtrength alſo, both defenſive and offenſive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Defenſive, for by their knitting together, they are able to make far more reſiſtance againſt the common adverſaries of their peace, then when they are ſingle and by themſelves. <hi>Vis unita for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</hi> A bundle of Arrowes together are not eaſily broken, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder, and they are eaſily ſnapt to pieces.

               <p n="2">2. Offenſive, for hereby they are the better able to prevail with God, againſt thoſe that annoy and hurt them: for the Saints thus together wraſtling with God, they do offer a kind of holy violence to his ſacred Majeſty, and obtaine their requeſts ſpeedily in Chriſt. As the heat of the Sunne, when the beames thereof meet together in a burning-glaſſe, is greatly ſtrengthened, ſo it is with the prayers of the Saints met thus together, they prevaile much with the ſtrong God, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>So <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2, 3. where we ſee the whole Church was called to looke out ſuch as were fit for the Deacons office. The people muſt chooſe, and the Apoſtles appoint, or deſigne, or ſet apart ſuch as were choſen. Now if the Apoſtles themſelves would not ſet apart Deacons to their office without the peoples approbation and free choice, much leſſe would they obtrude Paſtors on them without their conſent.</p>
               <p>So that of <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. the Originall reads it otherwiſe then the Tranſlation: the Tranſlation reads it <hi>ordained,</hi> but the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, they choſe Elders by the lifting up of the hands of the people, which is different from ordination, as Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is from the election of a King: and therefore when the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of election, he uſith this word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but when he ſpeaks of Ordination, he uſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which words, though in writing and ſound they are neere alike, yet in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114076:32"/> otherwiſe as much as betweene the lifting up of the hands, and the laying of them on. So that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19. abundantly proves this power of the whole Church. And to this agreeth the teſtimony of the Learned, both Ancient and Moderne, as (if need were) I could abundantly produce. But my labour is ſaved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by a late Treatiſe to this purpoſe, wherein the judgements of the Reformed Churches, and Proteſtant Divines, are abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared touching this, and other matters of like nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the power of adminiſtring the Cenſures, as excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, &amp;c. this alſo is in the Church, as appeares from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. which is to be underſtood of ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Church we now ſpeak of: becauſe when Chriſt ſpeaks of binding and looſing, he underſtands the Brethren, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> meaning thoſe that complaine. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is a truth we may not depart from, for although the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Cenſures be in the Elders and Officers of a Church, yet it is ſtill <hi>in ordine ad Eccleſiam,</hi> that is, in reference to the whole Church, whoſe ſervants they are. There is no ſuch particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the party offending, and the Elderſhip, as may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Elderſhip or Presbyterie, of a particular Church, to exerciſe ſuch an act of power over the party, no more then they may adminiſter the Sacraments to a private perſon; but to him as a Church member, and with the whole Church, ſo they are to act, and no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Another place is that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. where we find the whole Church is concerned in that buſineſſe of excommunicating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. to 10. there he writes to the whole Church againe, to releaſe, and abſolve, or forgive him: The Elders by ſentencing his abſolution and reſtitution, the Brethren by conſenting thereunto.</p>
               <p>Againe, is it not evident from the Aſian Churches, where we find Jeſus Chriſt to charge the neglect of cenſuring their guilty members upon ſome of them, as the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> both in one Chapter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.18, 20. Jeſus Chriſt was diſpleaſed with them, becauſe they did not put the power in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution he had given unto them, for the purging out of thoſe that offended. And it is worth obſervation, that Jeſus Chriſt doth not blame the neighbour Churches for the ſins of theſe Churches, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114076:33"/> layes all the blame upon themſelves: Which implyes clearely they had received power within themſelves to caſt out thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and reforme thoſe abuſers: Or elſe without queſtion, he would not have blamed them, for the neglect of that he never gave them. And therefore reverent M. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Expoſition on theſe Chapters ſaith, that God gave to every one of theſe Churches, power and authority to Preach the Word, adminiſter the Sacraments, reprove evill men, and exclude all obſtinate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from all ſpirituall priviledges among them, as will appeare from his teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond ſort of proofes, is from the teſtimony of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Divines; for what Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith of the priviledge of particular viſible Churches, is confirmed alſo by many more of our owne Engliſh Worthies, ſome that are aſleep in Chriſt with him, and others that are yet living. I will give you a liſt of ſome of the chiefeſt of them, men that have been famous in their generation, not onely for their admirable gifts of learning, judgement, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo for the ſervice they have done to Jeſus Chriſt in this and other Nations. And the rather, 1. becauſe this equality of power in the Churches of Chriſt, is looked upon by ſome as a novell and late upſtart opinion, held onely by ſuch as are poore, weak, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, unlearned men at beſt, men that are of a factious and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall temper. 2. Becauſe others of the moderate ſort affirme, that they differ onely in the point of Church rule and government, they approve of a communion of Saints, onely they ſuppoſe the power of Government is not in themſelves, but in the Claſſis and Synod. Now that it may appeare to be ſo, I ſhall produce theſe ſeverall teſtimonies following.</p>

Where are any particular men ſtanding Church Officers to the whole Nation by divine inſtitution? What Nationall Worſhip hath Chriſt inſtituted?

If onely <hi>civill diviſions</hi> of men, that may conveniently be taught by one Paſtor, and ruled by Elders, whereof ſome may be fit to partake of the Ordinances, ſome not, <hi>as the Presbyterians eſteeme them,</hi> then, &amp;c. So that here is no other then an humane conſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> allowed of to the pariſh Churches in England.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How doe theſe Pariſh Churches in <hi>England,</hi> anſwer to the former true viſible Church of Chriſt under the Goſpell in reſpect of the right matter of it, which we have ſhewed to be Saints? Now in this they come as ſhort as in the other, for experience tels us, that Pariſh Churches for the generall conſiſt of looſe, profane, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous livers, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſaith are <hi>without God,</hi> and <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>without hope, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. that are ſtrangers to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Iſrael, and covenant of Promiſe. Now we may ſafely argue from that Scripture, that ſuch as are without God, and without Chriſt, cannot make a Church of Chriſt. Beſides, the Kingdome of Chriſt, which is his Church, is ſpirituall, and not of this world, as he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. Now theſe pariſhes for the generality of their matter, are of this world, carnall and earthly, and therefore cannot be the Kingdome of Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt cannot be the Head of ſuch a Body, nor King of ſuch a Kingdome. Moreover, that cannot be the matter of Chriſts Church, which he hath commanded to be caſt out of his Church, as wee have ſhewed before. But the ſubject matter of the Pariſh Churches are ſuch, as ought to be caſt out from the Church of Chriſt. And therefore ſome of our more godly Brethren of the Presbyterian way, dare not admit of them to Church priviledges with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſeparate the godly from them, where they have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number by themſelves to adminiſter the ſeales to, as we could give inſtances, if need were. Neither will it be ſufficient in this caſe, to ſay as many doe, that the denomination is from the better part; becauſe we never find in the Scriptures, that holineſſe is aſcribed to a multitude for the ſake of a few, if the reſt be unholy, looſe and profane: As we doe not ſay, that becauſe ſuch a meeting hath three or foure Gentlemen or Nobles in it, that the whole
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114076:42"/> company are Gentlemen and Noblemen. We reade that uncleane perſons and things doe pollute and unhallow cleane perſons, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.46, 47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.4, 11, 12. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. and that a little leaven ſowres the whole lump, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6, 7. and that by the ſpringing up of one root of bitterneſſe, many are defiled; and that by one dead flye, the whole box of ointment is ſpoiled; but that cleane perſons ſhould hallow and ſanctifie perſons that are unholy, or that a little ſweet meale ſhould make ſweet a ſowre lump, this we read not of.</p>
               <p>Beſides, can it be made out by any man, that the matter of thoſe Pariſh Churches, for the moſt part, can anſwer the ends for which a Church is inſtituted by Chriſt, as we have noted before? can a company of diſſolute livers, worſhip God and Jeſus Chriſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually? can there be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity for ſpirituall and holy ſervices, where the Spirit is not yet given? can there be communion between light and darkneſſe, between Chriſt and Belial? as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. can they edifie one another in the moſt holy faith, that have not the work of faith yet wrought and begun in them? I deſire to know of any ſober-minded and religious-hearted man, whether a company of vile, profane drunkards, ſwearers, ſcoffers at goodneſſe, enemies to the power of godlineſſe, ignorant poore ſoules, that know no more of God and Chriſt, (I had almoſt ſaid then the ſeats they ſit on) can doe any thing in a Church ſociety, that tends to the honour of God, and edification of the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you ſay they are hearers of the Word, that is not ſufficient, for Heathens may doe that, and yet not be Church members, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24. The Scribes, and Phariſees, and other wicked Jewes, came often to heare Chriſt himſelf preach with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and yet they were not his Diſciples, but enemies, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, ſeeking to kill him. Tis not bare hearing the Word, that makes a perſon a member of Chriſt and his Church, but his willing and profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt and the Goſpel to be ruled and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you ſay, they are Profeſſors of Chriſt, yet that alſo, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in the life, is not ſufficient to make a member of Chriſt &amp; his Church, for 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. we are bid to turne from ſuch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you ſay, they are baptized. I anſwer, that is not ſufficient to make them members of this Church of Chriſt, becauſe the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114076:43"/> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath Baptiſme in it, and yet no true Church, as Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> hath well obſerved in his Expoſition on the Creed. A falſe Church may uſurpe Ordinances that hath no right to them, as well as a true church be for a time without them, that hath right to them. Neither is Baptiſme the forme of a church, or the way and meanes now left to bring men into the church, but a ſeale of Confirmation rather to thoſe that are already joyned to ſome particular viſible Church of Chriſt. And to adde no more, Baptiſme in it ſelfe is ſo far from making any man a church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as that church-memberſhip may be diſſolved, though Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme remaine, as in caſe of Excommunication.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you adde farther, and ſay, that the primitive viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as <hi>Corinth, Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. had profane wicked men in them: This neither will be to any purpoſe; for the queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a true viſible Church of Chriſt may have wicked perſons in it? for that is not denyed: but whether it is to be conſtituted &amp; made up of ſuch perſons. Tis one thing what theſe Primitive Churches may be through degeneration, another thing what they were in their firſt conſtitution. And therefore I ſuppoſe we are not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Churches for examples as they were in their degenerate eſtate, but as they were in their firſt planting, otherwiſe we do but delude the ſimple. Indeed if thoſe that plead ſo hotly for the Pariſh Churches could make it out, that in the beginning they had a pure conſtitution, and their firſt planting was <hi>juxta Evangelium Chriſti,</hi> it were ſomething, and their degenerating only from the right, ſhould not hinder us from the upholding of them. But till that be done, they muſt beare with us, if we labour the bringing of them to the Primitive rule and order of the Goſpel, which how it may be effected, I ſhall endeavour to hold forth in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you adde farther, that the Parables of the <hi>draw-net,</hi> and the <hi>tares</hi> and <hi>wheat</hi> together, ſeeme to hold out, that the viſible Church of Chriſt conſiſts of good and bad together. I anſwer in a word, if by the <hi>field</hi> it be granted is meant the viſible ſtate of the Church, though Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, by <hi>field</hi> is meant the <hi>world,</hi> which is never called the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.38, 39. but ſuppoſe it be taken for the viſible church of Chriſt, yet it cannot be underſtood of the eſſence and conſtitution of the church, which here we are diſputing of, and what ought to be the matter of ſuch a church, <hi>de jure,</hi> 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114076:43"/> Chriſt ſaith that thoſe Tares were ſowed in the field by the envious man, the Devill, through the careleſſnes of thoſe that were ſet over the Field to keepe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.39. So that if they be in the church, he hath no hand in it, tis not by his allowance, &amp; much leſſe his appointment and ordination, and therefore to make this more cleare, I adde this 2. reaſon, that if Jeſus Chriſt never ordained that wicked men ſhould be matter of his houſe, ſtones in his building, becauſe if this ſhould be true, then all thoſe commands of Chriſt for caſting them out of his church, when they are diſcovered to be in, ſhould be void, &amp; to no purpoſe: for if that wicked men which are the Tares, be the true matter of a church, &amp; of the true conſtitution of a viſible Church, then they are to be let alone &amp; not caſt out; leſt in ſo doing we deſtroy the church, ſin againſt the commandement of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that notwithſtanding what is ſaid for the matter of the pariſh churches, we ſee they cannot be found to be according to the firſt conſtitution of the Goſpell, and I feare thoſe that go about to ſet up a new building of Reformation, upon this rotten foundation will find in a ſhort time, that all they do will fall about their own eares.</p>

Again, it may be further demanded, how theſe pariſh-chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do anſwer to the church we have formerly ſpoken of, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their union and knitting together, by a free and voluntary conſent, which is the forme of a true viſible church of Chriſt: hath there ever been ſuch a knitting and combination of the Officers and Members, in an holy and unanimous conſent and agreement to walke together (as we have formerly ſhewed) according to the rule of Chriſt in the Goſpell? &amp;c. Is not the contrary evident? For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have not thoſe pariſhes been time out of mind under one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> church-government, and rule, for the outward worſhip of God, and diſpenſation of Ordinances?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have not Prelates and Patrons impoſed preachers over thoſe pariſhes, without, yea, many times againſt the approbation and conſent of the People?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have not the godly with the wicked in thoſe pariſhes, been alwayes mixed together in the ordinances and worſhip of God, making up one church frame and conſtitution, without any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hath not co-habitation, and comming within the bounds
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114076:44"/> and precincts of a pariſh, been ſufficient to make a perſon a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church in their ſence, though never ſo notorious a liver, ſo he be not poor, and (through his charge of children) burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the pariſh, never enquiring whether he be capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, and his Saints in the enjoyment of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore elſe is it, that now in theſe times of greater light and liberty, that many of our Presbyterian bretheren do beginne to gather the godly in their pariſhes into a body of themſelves, ſeparating the precious from the vile, in a way of acknowledging what worke of grace the Lord hath wrought in them, of which there would (I conceive) be no need, if they were already united and embodyed together?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, to ſpeake nothing of the rule by which they walke in the worſhip of God, it may be demanded, how theſe pariſh Churches, do anſwer to the pattern before ſet down, according to the Goſpell, in point of Diſcipline and government? do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the priviledges of church power within themſelves, without ſubordination to others? Have they not generally to this day been without it, ſtanding formerly under the authority of the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and their Courts, that uſed them at their pleaſure, and led them captive to their wills? Did not both Prieſt and people dance after their pipe? And if the claſſicall government do now take place, is it not to be feared, that they will be (poore ſoules) <hi>In ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu quo priùs,</hi> under as great bondage, if not greater then before? But for that, we leave it, till time (the diſcoverer of all things) make the truth known in this particular.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another inference from the former poſition, is this, to ſhew how great the ſinne is of thoſe that are called <hi>Seekers,</hi> that have been profeſſed members of ſuch a particular church of Saints rightly conſtituted according to the order of the Goſpell, but now have left it, denying any ſuch church, or churches, and Miniſtery to be, and ſo have left all communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Saints, in the ordinances of his worſhip, expecting a Miniſtery accompanied with the gifts of Miracles, as in the Apoſtles dayes: But ſuch men do not ſee how much Sathan hath blinded their eyes. I ſhall ſpeake more largely and directly to them in the fourth chapter of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:114076:44"/>6. Then it will follow in the laſt place, that the bretheren of the congregational way are not guilty of all thoſe foule crimes of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, hereſie, blaſphemyes, and of making ſchiſmes and rents in the church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they are accuſed by the tongues and pennes both of Preachers and profeſſors in the Presbyterian way: for the judicious Reader may ſee by what hath been already, and is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be laid downe, that thoſe that walke in this Separated Church-ſtate from the world, do not ſwerve from the way of the Lord, which he himſelfe hath inſtituted and commanded: nor from the judgement and practiſe of thoſe that have been ſome of the famous lights that have ſhined in this Kingdome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after all thoſe former aſperſions have been laid, and caſt upon them, they will be found in the truth, and God will make their enemies aſhamed, that ever they ſhould write ſuch volumnes, and waſte ſo many precious houres, to oppoſe and vex their righteous ſoules, for <hi>Magna eſt veritas, et praevalebit.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That the ſeverall adminiſtrations of this <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> eſpecially for <hi>Seales</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> are now in theſe dayes (ſince the death of the Apoſtles, and extraordinary Church-officers and governours) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to, and bounded within every particular Church: the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of one Congregation, may not ordinarily &amp; in common, (as the Apoſtles did) adminiſter the <hi>Seales</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> that belongs to another Congregation.</head>
               <p>Now the truth of this I ſhall endeavour to make out, in theſe ten following Concluſions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. THat all Miniſteriall power for adminiſtration of Seales, and execution of Church cenſures, was firſt given in commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Apoſtles only; as theſe Scriptures hold forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. And therefore we read oftentimes of <hi>Peters</hi> baptiſing <hi>Cornelius</hi> and others, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. and <hi>Pauls</hi> excommunicating of <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. and ſuch like acts of theirs, which they did by themſelves alone, as the firſt Subjects of this executive Church-power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe Apoſtles were immediately called, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily gifted by Chriſt for this worke and employment of their Miniſtery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21, 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That theſe extraordinary officers were only <hi>Protempore,</hi> and ſo were the laſt, as well as the firſt ſubject of this power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo that when they dyed, their extraordinary call and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, together with their extraordinary gifts for the diſcharge of it, dyed with them, as may be gathered from <hi>Asts</hi> 20.29. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath manifeſted ſoon after their deceaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Jeſus Chriſt the Head and King of his Church, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wiſdome, ordained ſuch to ſucceed them, which ſhould (though they were not ſo extraordinarily called and qualifyed) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and effect that great worke of gathering and perfecting the Saints, which are his body the Church, as is evident from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That theſe kind of ordinary officers, as <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> were (in the very times of the Apoſtles, and by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114076:45"/> with the conſent of the people) begunne to be choſen and ſetled in particular Churches and Congregations, as appeares from <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>and</hi> 20.28. and appointed to be perpetuall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Churches of Chriſt to his comming again, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That theſe ordinary officers were charged by the Apoſtles to looke to their owne flocks, over which the holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers, as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. and the People al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to obey them, and ſubmit themſelves to them, as <hi>Heb</hi> 13.17. &amp; that notable place, of 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. where he ſhewes how that <hi>Church</hi> ſhould know them <hi>that were</hi> over <hi>them in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>did labour amongſt them, and admoniſh them,</hi> and how highly they ſhould account of them for their workes ſake, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. In which Scripture he excellently and clearely holds forth the truth of the Propoſition in hand, by diſcovering that ſpeciall relation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe officers and the members of that Church, three times in one verſe, which labour <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and admoniſh you:</hi> where we ſee the Apoſtle ſtill keepes himſelfe to the <hi>Pronoune Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, Vos, vos,</hi> you, you, not others, ſo much as you (viz.) mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that particular <hi>Church,</hi> to whom theſe Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were related.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That theſe Paſtors and Teachers, did obey for the moſt part this charge and command of the Apoſtles, as we ſee in the former inſtance; neither can we read that the officers of one particular Church did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, play the Biſhops in other mens Dioceſſes: they did not adminiſter the Seales and cenſures out of their own Churches: they might preach and pray in other Churches beſide their own, but not adminiſter Seales and cenſures; the reaſon is, becauſe there is a greater liberty allowed by Chriſt in the one, then in the other.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the office of a Paſtor and Teacher, is founded in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that is between the Church and the officer, or officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: now the Church under the Goſpell, to which theſe officers doe belong, is not Univerſall, and Nationall, or Dioceſan (as we in the former Chapter made manifeſt) but congregationall only, (viz.) <hi>ſuch a company of believers as can meet together to worſhip God in one place:</hi> and therefore the execution of their office, cannot be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, but limited to the congregation to which they belong,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114076:46"/> eſpecially, in the adminiſtration of the Seales and Cenſures.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That no ſuch Officer, as Paſtor, &amp;c. can require from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church or Congregation beſides his own to which he belongs, and over which the holy Ghoſt hath made him overſeer, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, maintenance, and obedience, which is due from people to officers, as appeares from<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Ariſt.</note> ſo Chriſt hath ordained in his Church, to each congregation their proper Paſtors and overſeers, and they that know what belongs to the worke, will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they have not enough to go through, and anſwer for, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That no ſuch Paſtor and Teacher (lawfully called to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church and charge of ſoules) may eaſily tranſlate himſelfe from ſuch a Church to another; but attend on that office and worke he is called unto, notwithſtanding many hardſhips he meets with: the reaſon is, becauſe ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And though the teſtimony of the learned doth not in the leaſt adde any worth or weight to the Scripture, yet becauſe many men think nothing is authenticall, that hath not evidence from learned men, I will adde the judgement of two, among many famous writers, M. <hi>Calvin</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and M. <hi>Baines</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

The words tranſlated are theſe; he having ſpoken of what helps a Miniſter of one Church may afford to another, by way of councell in any darke and difficult matter; he preſently addes, <hi>But for as much as for the keeping of the Peace of the Church,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114076:46"/> this politie is neceſſary, that there be ſet forth to every man, what he ſhould doe, leſt all be confuſedly diſ-ordered, runne about without calling, or raſhly runne all together into one place; and leſt ſuch as are more carefull for their own commodity, then for the edification of the Church, ſhould at their own will leave their churches vacant: this ordering ought commonly to be kept ſo neer as may be, that every man contented with his own bounds, ſhould not breake into another mans charge: And this is no invention of man, but the ordinance of God himſelfe. For we read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>made Presbyters or Miniſters in all the churches of</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, Iconium, <hi>and</hi> Antioch, Act. 14.22, 33. <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>commands</hi> Tytus <hi>that he ordain Elders in every towne,</hi> Tit. 1.5. <hi>elſewhere he mentioneth the Biſhops which were at</hi> Philippi, Phil. 1.1. <hi>and</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Coloſſ.

               <p n="2">2. Whether they do not by this their practiſe, not only confound thoſe offices which Jeſus Chriſt, the King of his church hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. but alſo hereby hold forth to the world, 1. That the extraordinary offices of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts are not to this day ceaſed, whoſe commiſſion did extend it ſelfe to all Churches? 2. That they preſume to have the ſame Call, Warrant, and Commiſſion for what they do, which the Apoſtles had at firſt from Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether they do not take that to them, and upon them, by this their practiſe, which the Apoſtles themſelves by all their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, did never give to the officers and Elders of particular churches? for we never read that ever the Apoſtles did give in command, that the Elders and Miniſters of particular churches, ſhould extend the exerciſe of the office, eſpecially the adminiſtration of the Seals and cenſures (which is the point we ſpeake to) beyond the bounds of their own congregation?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, whether hereby they do not only by this their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, occaſion from and by others, the pollutions &amp; prophanation of the holy things of Gods Houſe, but alſo lay ſtumbling blocks in the way of many precious and godly ſoules, that would come off from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114076:49"/> their old wayes of confuſion, did they not diſcerne ſuch practiſes in thoſe that take upon them to be guides and leaders of others: for are we not ordinarily upbraided with theſe and the like words, Do you not ſee, how ſuch and ſuch godly men, reverend Miniſters, and learned Divines, make no ſcruple at all of adminiſtring the Seales, eſpecially that of Baptiſme, to thoſe that are not of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? and thus according to the old ſaying, <hi>Plus proſunt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla, quam praecepta,</hi> multitudes are kept from comming to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the pure ordinances of Chriſt, in the right order of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will follow alſo from hence unavoidably, that thoſe many Chriſtians (the truth of whoſe grace and union with the head and foundation we queſtion not) which of late dayes (calling into queſtion the truth and lawfullnes of their firſt baptiſme) have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the practiſe of <hi>rebaptizing,</hi> and taking up the Ordinance of baptiſme, <hi>De novo,</hi> are utterly void, and altogether to ſeeke of a <hi>true and a juſt ground from the Scripture</hi> for their practiſe herein, and ſo this <hi>latter</hi> baptiſme of theirs, will be found as <hi>unlawfull</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ground they held their <hi>firſt unlawfull:</hi> (becauſe) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully adminiſtred.</hi> For if the adminiſtration of the Seales be now tyed to ordinary officers, and theſe to a particular Church, ſince the Apoſtles times, that give them their lawfull and right call to adminiſter the ordinances, then it will follow that there is no lawfull baptiſme, but by him that is an officer of ſome particular Church, and he that is an officer of ſome particular church, muſt have a lawfull calling <hi>from the Church to which he is an officer,</hi> for all extraordinary officers that had their call and commiſſion <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from heaven,</hi> are ceaſed: now thoſe which rebaptize, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove the taking up of that ordinance again <hi>after this manner,</hi> but are enforced to hold, that a Diſciple in common, that by the exerciſe of his gifts, doth convert a ſinner from the evill of his wayes, may alſo baptize him; which if true, then firſt of all, what need of Chriſts ordaining officers in a Church for theſe purpoſes? Secondly, then why may not a godly woman (by her good exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and chaſte converſation, converting her husband) baptize him alſo, which I ſuppoſe they are farre from maintaining, and yet it neceſſarily followes, the ground they build their practiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherefore three things I ſhall here propoſe (in the ſpirit of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114076:49"/> love and meekneſſe) to be ſeriouſly and conſcienciouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be any lawfull baptiſme, where the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator hath no lawfull calling thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the lawfull call to the diſpenſing of that ordinance of baptiſme be not now, (in theſe dayes of the Goſpell) from or by that particular Church, and ſociety of Saints, to which that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator or officer doth belong.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether a perſons entring on ſuch an action of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his own meer private motion, or ſuppoſition of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and immediate call from heaven, wanting the ordinary inſtituted way of Chriſt in the Goſpell, be not a ſtrong deluſion, and an occaſion of leading them into dangerous errors, as we find by wofull experience, to wit, <hi>univerſall grace, free-will, denying origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the decrees af God to be abſolute.</hi> And of late there is a ſmall Pamphlet that goes under M: <hi>Francis Cornwals</hi> name, (a great pleader for rebaptizing, and champion againſt <hi>Paedobaptiſme</hi>) that hath diverſe unſound things in it, deceiving the ſimple, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other theſe two that follow.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that thoſe that are not able to make out a confeſſion of their beliefe in Jeſus the Chriſt, are therefore not born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. Then it muſt follow, that there is no ſalvation where there is no actuall profeſſion, and confeſſion of faith; Nay, that there is no worke of inherent and habituall ſanctification and regeneration, where there is not ability and power to hold it forth, which how falſe, and againſt the very letter of the word, thoſe that have but halfe an eye may diſcerne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe that refuſe and deny to be baptized, (that is, after that manner he there ſpeaks of all along, by making a confeſſion of their faith, and going into the water to be dipt) have no promiſe to receive the gifts of the Spirit, but rather ſhall be given up to ſtrong deluſions to believe a lye, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. Now whether this poore man be not given up to ſtrong deluſions in writing as he doth in in this manner, let any underſtanding man judge: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meanes the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, as the gifts of Miracles, that ſuch as are not ſo baptized, have no promiſe to receive; or elſe he underſtands the ordinary and uſuall ſanctifying gifts of the Spirit, that all the elect have in their regeneration, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114076:50"/> to God: Now let him take either of theſe, or both, and he ſhall find how he is deluded: For as for the firſt ſort of gifts, wee have a cleare inſtance that they were powred out upon <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe that heard the word with him, from the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they were baptized, or came neare the water, or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, as we find <hi>Act.</hi> 14.44, 45, 46. So that it ſeems the gifts of the Spirit did precede baptiſme, not follow it: And if it ſhould be demanded of him, whether ſince his rebaptizing, and other of his way, they have received thoſe gifts of ſpeaking tongues, and healing all manner of diſeaſes, and caſting out of Devils; I feare they would be to ſeeke of anſwering affirmatively: and why then do men ſpeake ſo confidently of that they have no warrant for, nor experience of? And then for the ſecond ſort of gifts, thoſe which are proper only to the Elect, as Faith, Repentance, and the like; its as cleare as the Sunne in the firmament, that they are in the hearts, and put forth many times in the lives of elect perſons, before ever they were baptized; as we ſee in the new converts, and the Eunuch, Jaylor, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, and others: and experience ſhewes it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to this day, in thoſe that were never baptized by way of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. But to make the vanity of this doctine to appeare fully, is it not evident from Chriſts own mouth, that the promiſe of the Spirit is to believing ſimply without the leaſt mention of baptiſme? as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>Which they that believe on him ſhould receive,</hi> not they that are baptized.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will unavoidably follow from hence, that the power of Miniſters in a Claſſis or Synod, exerciſing authority and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the name of Chriſt, over more Congregations and Churches then their own to which they belong, is altogether unwarrantable, and not from Scripture: for if the adminiſtration of the Seales, and execution of Church cenſures, that officers are intruſted with, be appropriated to their own Congregations, then it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when they take upon them the government, ordering and cenſuring of other Churches, they violate thoſe ſacred bonds which Jeſus Chriſt hath tyed them to.</p>
               <p>And for this M. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Heart Diviſions,</hi> is very cleare, 6.22. <hi>p.</hi> 157. where having laid down the chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie now on foot, he gives two conſiderations to helpe us in our thoughts about it,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114076:50"/>1. <hi>That the</hi> extent <hi>of power of jurisdiction, muſt be by inſtitution, aſwell as the power it ſelfe; all juridicall power whatſoever, either in State or Church, receives limits or extent, from the ſame authority it firſt had its riſe: this is impoſſible to be denyed. If a man by a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made a Major of a towne, he cannot therefore challenge the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a Major whereſoever he comes, except the authority that firſt gave him his power ſhall alſo extend it: now the Charter by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church officer is inveſted with power is the word, and therefore we cannot ſtraiten or enlarge the power of a Miniſter, otherwiſe then we find it in the word, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That a man naturally, is of nothing more impatient, then to have jurisdiction challenged over him, except he ſees the claime to be right: &amp; in the point of ſpirituall jurisdiction, man is the moſt tender of all, becauſe in that men come in the name of Chriſt to him, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging authority to exerciſe the power of Chriſt over him, not over the outward man, ſo much as over his ſoule, to deliver it up to</hi> Sathan; <hi>ſurely there had need be ſhewn a cleare and full charter, that any men have, that gives them ſuch a power as this, that men in conſcience ſhould be bound to ſubmit to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. You will ſay, what helpe or remedy can there be, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of a Church, or a whole Church ſhould erre, as its poſſible?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> See what the ſame M. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith in his anſwer to <hi>M. Edwards, p.</hi> 31. where he hath this very queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church (ſaith he) is a ſpirituall ſociety, gathered for ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ends; it hath within it ſelfe no helpe againſt ſpirituall evils, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and theſe can only prevaile with men, ſo farre as they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall &amp; conſciencious. If the declaring the mind of Chriſt by other churches, if the proteſting againſt erring Elders or churches, and withdrawing communion from them, will not ſtrike upon conſcience, what ſhall? Can the adding of an act of formall jurisdiction, whoſe divine inſtitution few ſee,</hi> (and I may adde, which the Presbyterians themſelves have no precept from Chriſt, nor example in all the primitive Churches to ſhew for) <hi>and is doubted of by thoſe, with whom it ſhould prevaile: can that do it? The former meanes will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy evils if men be conſciencious, the latter will not do it, if men be not conſciencious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Magiſtrate muſt come in and helpe.</p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>Then in Church helpe there is little difference between the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114076:51"/> Presbyters and the Independents, whatſoever they pretend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in the point of church power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If you intereſſe the Magiſtrates power, he muſt then either by himſelfe, or by ſome commiſſion, take cognizance of the</hi> jus <hi>and fact wherein his power is to be exerciſed, he muſt not act upon an implicite beliefe, that the acts of the church are right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Will you call in his power in all matters of difference, wherein your ſelves cannot agree, or will you only deſire his power to helpe, when either the hainouſneſſe of the matter, or the turbulency of the carriage manifeſts ſtubbornneſſe? If in the former caſe, then you make the Magiſtrate the Iudge of all controverſies in Religion, which I believe you are not willing to do: If in the latter only, wee are agreed. Why then is there ſuch a ſtirre, ſuch an out-cry, againſt that which is called the Independent way? as if there muſt needs be a confuſion of all things, if liberty in it be granted. The Lord judge between us and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren in this thing, to him wee referre our names, and our cauſe.</hi> Thus that eminent and famous ſervant of Chriſt in the concluſion of his Vindication againſt M. <hi>Edwards.</hi> And if any deſire further ſatisfaction touching the undue power of the claſſicall way, he may read at large M. <hi>Damports Reply</hi> to M. <hi>Paget, ſect</hi> 27. <hi>p.</hi> 226, to 231. and 254, 255.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next inference from the former poſition, is this. That thoſe of the <hi>Congregationall way,</hi> commonly known by the nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Independents;</hi> do not walke without a rule for what they do, in appropriating the adminiſtrations of Seales and Cenſures, to their own particular Congregations; nor ſinne againſt Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to adminiſter the Seales to ſuch, as are not in fellowſhip with them, nor any other true viſible Church of Chriſt. I know it is layd to the charge of ſuch, as if they were proud and ſcornfull, but it is no other then an aſperſion: for if this be the revealed will of Chriſt, that the adminiſtration of the Seales is limited to Paſtors and Teachers, and they to their owne particular charge, then if they had all the humility in the world, that is in the hearts of the Saints, yet that would not allow them to go againſt the leaſt part of the revealed will and mind of Chriſt, which they ſhould do, if they ſhould adminiſter Church ordinances, to ſuch as are of no Church, and refuſe alſo to ſit downe in fellowſhip with them.

                  <hi>In all worſhip that belongs to Saints, as Saints, they joyfully joyn with them, that is</hi> (as I conceive) <hi>in prayer, hearing of the word, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference, and duties of ſuch like nature, that concerne chriſtian communion: but as for that worſhip that belongs to Saints as gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a ſociety under officers, ſo they judge it unreaſonable that any ſhould have the benefit of the priviledges of the Church, and yet be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no power nor diſcipline of any Church, but live at liberty, and pick &amp; chooſe ordinances where they pleaſe, &amp; if they walk diſorderly, have no Church to call them to an account.</hi> And therfore hence forward let not men cenſure us as they have done, for the diſcharge of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Indeed if it were meere will and not conſcience, that did lead &amp; guide us, it were another matter, but when (through riches of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) we can upon good grounds appeale to the Lord, that it is meer conſcience and not will that leads and ſwayes us, let them take heed how they paſſe ſuch unrighteous judgement on their brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, leſt that of our Saviour light on them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Iudge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> I would only deſire to know this one thing, of ſuch raſh and bitter cenſurers of their brethren, what profit &amp; advantage it can be to us, to expoſe our names to reproach, our perſons to contempt, and all we have to hazard, if wee were not perſwaded of the truth of what wee practiſe, and that we ſhould ſinne againſt God, if wee ſhould (to pleaſe men) do the contrary. Beſides, is it not wel known that we ſtrive to go ſo farre as we may poſſibly, <hi>with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for the ſatisfying of thoſe that are contrary minded? what would men have yet further of us, unleſſe it be to ſin againſt the light of truth God hath revealed to us? let but a few things be duely conſidered, &amp; then ſee whether we are guilty of thoſe abominable and foule crimes that are laid to our charge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe of the Congregationall way, are content to receive ſuch into communion and church fellowſhip, upon their proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, that differ from them in their judgement, <hi>in things of leſſer conſequence and moment,</hi> ſo long as they have good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and teſtimony of their upright converſation, and find them willing to ſit down with them, and ſubmit themſelves to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches proceedings, as farre as God ſhall give them light.</p>

They are ſtudious of taking notice of <hi>the leaſt breathings of Chriſt,</hi> in thoſe that <hi>offer themſelves</hi> to joyn with them in Church communion, whether poore or rich, condiſcending to the meaneſt worke of grace, where they have any the leaſt hintes of truth and ſincerity, being aſſured that Chriſt hath appointed his green Paſtures for his weake Lambes, as well as for his grown ſheep.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are willing to give liberty to any ſuch poore ſoules to manifeſt what God hath done for them in uniting them to Chriſt the foundation, (not to make a confeſſion of their ſinnes, as many report) for the ſatisfying of thoſe <hi>that ſhall have communion with them</hi> in the holy things of God, (which is no more then reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) either before the whole Church publiquely, or elſe if they are weake and baſhfull (as many are) to the<note n="*" place="margin">And thus much the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves practiſe in their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men and women to the Sacrament.</note> Paſtor in private, with one or two more of the Church, and they to tranſmit it to the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If they meet with broken language, and bad and low expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as oftentimes it falles out) yet they make not that a ground of refuſall, ſo there be <hi>ſufficient teſtimony</hi> of the holines of the life, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a profeſſion as carries with it no palpable contradiction in mens walking, but is accompanied with the power of Religion and godlines.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They bind not any to a formall and expreſſe written cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at their comming in (as they are commonly ſlandered with) but only, after ſatisfaction is given, demand their <hi>willingnes</hi> to give up themſelves to the Lord, &amp; his Church, &amp; to walke together in the mutuall diſcharge of thoſe duties that concerneth ſuch a Church-ſtate, and Goſpell relation, upon the manifeſtation whereof, they are admitted to fellowſhip and uſe of the ordinances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If any are not found fit upon tryall, they are only deſired to wait a while, till God ſhall bring them into a further capacity.

               </head>
               <p>BEfore I enter on the evidencing and making clear of the truth of this Propoſition, I deſire to premiſe this one thing, to wit, that by this <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> I do not here underſtand, any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſingle Congregation, reſiding in any one place or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but the inſtituted ſtate of Chriſts viſible Church, in one place or other, conſiſting of few or many, whether in liberty or bondage, in purity or corruption, according to its ſeverall and various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to which it is ſubject, and in which, for the eſſentiall and integrall parts thereof, it is kept and preſerved by the Almighty power and preſence of Jeſus Chriſt; for doubtleſſe in reſpect of this or that particular Church, and ſingle congregation, it may ceaſe and be utterly loſt, but in reſpect of the eſſentials of that inſtituted Church-ſtate and order of Chriſt, revealed to us in his word, and delivered to us by the Apoſtles, and left by them upon record for us to follow and practice: ſo it is not loſt, but remains and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the Saints to his comming again. Now that this is the truth of God, I ſhall endeavour to make out, 1. from Scripture, 2. from Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Scriptures that hold out this truth, they are of three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Propheſies,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>and</hi> 59.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Precepts, Mat.</hi> 28.20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14. to which I might adde the judgements of many learned men, it there were need. All which do clearely ſhew the perpetuity and continuance of this Goſpell <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> in all ages to the comming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Arguments that confirme the perpetuity of this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114076:53"/> 
                  <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> and confute the contrary that is affirmed by many, <hi>viz.</hi> the ceſſation of it, they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the government of <hi>Chriſts church,</hi> which the Father hath given him, and he hath accepted, ſhall never have an end, then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that this <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> cannot ceaſe, to which this government hath relation, unleſſe we can ſuppoſe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> can be <hi>a King without a Kingdome, a Head without a Body, a Husband without a Spouſe,</hi> which once to imagine, is exceeding diſhonourable to him, and little leſſe then blaſphemy.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33.</note> But now the Scriptures are cleare, that the government of Chriſt in his Church ſhall never have an end, as we have ſhewed before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this Church-ſtate, which Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted, for the eſſentialls of it, ſhould ceaſe, and not be continued in all ages, then it would follow, that there would be a time, when the gates of Hell ſhould prevaile againſt it, and his preſence with it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.1</note> to the end of the world, ſhould not continue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2</note> and ſo all his promiſes to the contary ſhould be void and of none effect: But this cannot be, <hi>for he is faithfull that hath promiſed, and not one jot or tittle of his word ſhall periſh, or be made void:</hi> and therefore there muſt needs be a perpetuity, and continuance of this church-ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Temple of God, which is his viſible Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. and 11.1, 2. doth remain where <hi>Antichriſt ſits,</hi> even as the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> did, where the <hi>ſeate of Sathan was, Rev.</hi> 2.13. then this Church-ſtate is not ceaſed, but remaines to this day.

For ye are the Temple of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God:</hi> In all which places, with diverſe other, that word Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is uſed for the viſible Church, becauſe the Apoſtle there ſpeakes to, and of the whole Church of <hi>Corinth conjunctim, Ye are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, &amp;c.</hi> So that by Temple here where <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſits, is to be underſtood the Church of God.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>You will ſay, by</hi> Temple <hi>is meant the</hi> conſciences <hi>of Gods people, in that place of the</hi> Theſſalonians.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Grant it, yet that doth not make void the other, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmes it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We never read in all the Scriptures, that the <hi>conſcience</hi> is ſo called, but the church of Chriſt is frequently ſo ſtyled, as wee have ſhewed before: and therefore, either its the Church of God, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſits in, or it is not; if not, then that Scripture is not true; but if true, as cannot be denyed, then there is a church-ſtate remaining under Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But how can this church-ſtate remaine, where there is ſuch a generall defection, as there is under Antichriſt? Rev.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>the corruption of things,</hi> and <hi>the things themſelves,</hi> between the <hi>eſſentials of a</hi> church-ſtate, and <hi>the accidentals:</hi> now it cannot be denyed, but in reſpect of the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentalls</hi> of a church-ſtate, ſo all is loſt, under this defection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, that is, in reſpect of the right order and adminiſtration of Miniſtery, Ordinances, and government, but not the eſſentials of theſe; and ſo long as theſe remaine, the Church-ſtate is not loſt: for we cannot reaſon from the corruption of a thing, <hi>to the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and non-being of it:</hi> as <hi>for example,</hi> the children of Iſrael, and veſſels of Gods Houſe, that were carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and prophaned by their being there, yet ſo long as they were not <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and broken in pieces,</hi> they were brought back again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>ſanctifyed from their pollution,</hi> and ſet againe in the <hi>Temple</hi> as before, and the Lord owned and accepted them notwithſtanding their being in <hi>Babylon:</hi> ſo here <hi>the Saints</hi> and <hi>ordinances,</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, Seales</hi> and <hi>Cenſures</hi> of this inſtituted Church of Chriſt, though they have been under Antichriſt, yet ſo long as the <hi>eſſence</hi> of them remaines, they may be brought back from <hi>Rome,</hi> and reduced to their former purity, and firſt order of the Goſpell, not that they have a <hi>new being,</hi> but rather they are brought to their wonted <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being,</hi> and primitive inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Obj. But doth not this then make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a true Church, having the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of <hi>a true Church-ſtate</hi> in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No not <hi>a jot,</hi> no more then a <hi>Theeves</hi> having the goods of an honeſt man in his houſe, which he hath ſtollen, makes him to be true, <hi>he is a thiefe</hi> ſtill. So here <hi>Rome</hi> is ſtill <hi>Rome, the mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114076:54"/> ſtil,</hi> notwithſtanding her poſſeſſing of the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: we may ſee it clearely in <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, the type of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Jewes were carried away captive with the holy veſſels of the Temple, twas not the <hi>being of theſe</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> that made her the church of God, but ſhe was <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtill, full of abominations, there was <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Merodach,</hi> her great Idols and Images ſtill worſhiped, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.2. and as God once overthrew the Type, (as he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi>) ſo that not ſo much as a ſon of man ſhould dwell there, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. So ſhall be it with the <hi>Antitype, Rome, the mother of fornications, the habitation of devils,</hi> and the hold of <hi>every foule ſpirit, Rev.</hi> 18.22, 23. and the good Lord, for his Son, and <hi>Syons</hi> ſake, haſten it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> be all loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defection of Antichriſt: then the <hi>Scriptures</hi> alſo are loſt, which are the churches <hi>treaſure,</hi> and as a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> were once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the <hi>church</hi> to keepe, <hi>Iud.</hi> 3. but we find that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not loſt, but by the power of Chriſt they have been <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> yea <hi>recovered</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and freed from thoſe horrible corruptions, they were expoſed unto, while they were in the hands of Antichriſt, and why may not the Ordinances as well as the Scriptures, the church as well as her treaſure?</p>
               <p n="5">5. If this <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> ſhould not continue, but were all loſt and ceaſed, then it would follow, that there were no meanes left <hi>ordinarily</hi> for the converſion and ſalvation of poore loſt ſoules; but the contrary to this appeares, as wee find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, for 1. We have the word of life in the ſacred Scriptures to be our <hi>Cynoſura</hi> or rule and guide to direct us in the way to life. 2. We have the holy Ghoſt accompanying the Miniſtery and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this word, in an <hi>effectuall</hi> manner, to the calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of multitudes, and bringing thoſe that are called out of their <hi>Antichriſtian-church-ſtate,</hi> to <hi>Sion,</hi> and to worſhip God according to his own revealed will. 3. We have Paſtors and teachers <hi>lawfully called,</hi> and ſet apart to the worke of the Miniſtery, and faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of this word of life, and other ordinances, that concern a true viſible Church-ſtate, according to the practiſe of the Primitive Churches, as we before ſhewed: now where there are the ſame word and ordinances, the ſame Officers for kind with thoſe in the Apoſtles dayes, to diſpenſe and adminiſter them, and the precious
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114076:55"/> preſence of Chriſt in his Spirit, accompanying them, to make them effectuall, (though perhaps not in ſuch an ample &amp; large meaſure as in thoſe Primitive times) there we may conclude the <hi>ordinary meanes for ſalvation are not loſt,</hi> but ſtill remaine and continue.</p>

I deſire to know, where it appeares, or how it can be made out, that the Primitive Saints, <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> were given to ſucceeding ages, as <hi>patternes</hi> for <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> that they were left as patternes of grace, and helps of faith, and love, and repentance, and obedience to the truth of Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, is without controverſie, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. but not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And the Apoſtle makes it cleere in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 4. that the <hi>chief end</hi> of gifts of Miracles, was to <hi>confirme</hi> the Goſpel of Chriſt, then ſent forth to be preached, which now needs not; for as M. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> lately in one of his Lectures on the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſhewed, <hi>common education</hi> ſerves <hi>ſo farre now,</hi> as <hi>Miracles</hi> did of old, which were not to begin a ſaving, juſtifying faith, for that was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Word, but to make men to <hi>attend the Word,</hi> which now <hi>education</hi> doth, and therefore there is no ſuch need of a Miniſtery with Miracles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth not the Scripture abundantly ſhew us, that working of <hi>Miracles</hi> may be in a falſe Miniſtery, as <hi>Marke</hi> 13.22. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14. <hi>and</hi> 19.20. and in ſuch
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114076:55"/> as Chriſt will not owne for his at the laſt day; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Doth not ſuch an <hi>opinion</hi> as this, of requiring gifts of working Miracles in thoſe that are called and ſent to preach and adminiſter ordinances, bring a great diſparagement on the <hi>truth</hi> it ſelfe, for if it be not able to make it ſelfe evident without Miracles, is it not a great Argument of its <hi>weaknes and inſufficiency?</hi> whereas its farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with the truth, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Doth not this opinion directly croſſe and contradict that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. and derogate from the authority and power of the Spirit, for there he tels us, that its the office of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to convince <hi>the world of ſinne, of righteouſnes and judgement:</hi> now to ſay that this worke cannot be done unleſſe there be <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by men, that are the Spirits inſtruments, what is this, but to <hi>derogate</hi> from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to make the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to depend more upon the externall working of <hi>Miracles,</hi> then upon the internall working of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> whereas the <hi>greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> that ever were wrought by the Apoſtles or others, can <hi>never prevaile</hi> to gaine the hearts of wretched ſinners, to the embracing of the truth, nor convince them of <hi>ſin, righteouſneſſe, and judgement,</hi> if the <hi>Spirits preſence</hi> be wanting, and therefore many times wee find amongſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that notwithſtanding <hi>all the Miracles</hi> that Chriſt himſelfe, and his Apoſtles wrought before them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>obſtinate and hardned</hi> in their ſinnes; ſo that the efficacy of the <hi>meanes</hi> depends on the Spirit, and if ſo, then there is no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for working of <hi>Miracles</hi> to convince men of the truth: for be the <hi>externall meanes</hi> or <hi>inſtrument weake</hi> or <hi>ſtrong,</hi> it matters not, ſo the Spirit employ it: and commonly we find it to be true by experience, that the weaker the ſecondary cauſe or meanes is, the <hi>more glorious</hi> doth the power of the Spirit appeare, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28, 29.</p>

               <p>The truth of the Propoſition being thus cleared, I now come to ſome inferences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, it will cleerly follow, that thoſe men are mightily miſtaken and <hi>out of the way,</hi> that ſtick not to affirme, that the Church-ſtate and order of Government <hi>thereunto correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted, is <hi>mutable,</hi> and ought to be <hi>ſuited</hi> according to the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of particular <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> as if the Churches of Chriſt in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times had a mixt government and adminiſtration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, according to the lawes and cuſtomes of the countryes: As for example, the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Aſia</hi> had one way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Churches in <hi>Galatia</hi> another way of order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Churches in <hi>Judea</hi> another. Whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmes the cleane contrary, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath left but <hi>one order of Church ſtate</hi> and <hi>politie</hi> for <hi>all his Churches</hi> to obſerve and make uſe of, which as I have ſhewed in the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of it, is unchangeable, and to be obſerved and kept to the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, the author and inſtituter of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14. and therefore what the Apoſtle ordained in one Church, he did in all, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. And this is the judgement of learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> againſt <hi>Duraeus,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> againſt <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who handles this point very largely in his ſecond Reply, his words are theſe: <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Whitgift) where the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, to keep the order which God hath ſet in his Church: you bring him in as a breaker and changer of the order, which God hath appointed by his holy Apoſtles: But the godly Chriſtian Magiſtrates may underſtand, that as neither our Saviour Chriſt, nor any wiſe and well inſtructed Miniſtery under him, will meddle with any order
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114076:56"/> or forme of Common wealth lawfully inſtituted of them, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter government of their people, but leave them as they find them: So</hi> they <hi>ought to leave whole and untouched, that order that Jeſus Chriſt hath placed in his Church.</hi> And as the Author ſaith truly in another place, <hi>that Chriſt came not to overthrow civill governments; even ſo,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it is as true, that God ſendeth not Kings to overthrow Church Government, planted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Yea ſo much more abſurd is this latter then the firſt, by how much they ought to have more firmity, which were ſet downe by the Lord himſelf, then which were by men. For what ſonne of Adam ſhall preſume to alter that order, which the Lord himſelfe from heaven hath ſet? &amp;c.</hi> And therefore certainly <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> will give ſuch men but little thanks another day, for their endeavour to make his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> as <hi>a noſe of waxe,</hi> to be <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> to whatſoever <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion</hi> men ſhall pleaſe in every <hi>Civill State</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> on earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I ſhall paſſe from ſuch <hi>Formaliſts</hi> and <hi>Time-ſervers,</hi> to another ſort of men, who although they <hi>allow</hi> not of an <hi>alteration</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Inſtitutions and Ordinances,</hi> yet plainly hold a <hi>ceſſation of them</hi> for the preſent, and therefore forſake the <hi>Aſſemblies of the Saints,</hi> to which they were joyned, and ſay there are <hi>no Churches, no Ordinances, no Miniſtery</hi> now, to diſpenſe them, but all loſt under Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch men may ſee the evill of their opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice herein, and ſo (if it be the good pleaſure of Chriſt) they may come to repent, and doe their firſt works, and returne to the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tents,</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt feedeth and cauſeth his flock to reſt at noone, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7, 8.

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>throughout all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>ages.</hi> Now how could this Scripture be true, if there be an or generation in which this Church ſtate doth ceaſe and is utterly loſt? So that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. where the holy Ghoſt alſo ſhewes, that the Lords death, that is, the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> in the adminiſtration of the Supper, is to be obſerved and made uſe of by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114076:57"/> the Saints <hi>in Church-fellowſhip,</hi> for their benefit and comfort, to <hi>his comming againe.</hi> Now how can this be, if the Church, and Miniſtery, and Ordinances are all loſt and ceaſed? And that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. and 28. laſt verſe, in which places Chriſt promiſeth to be with his Churches and people in the adminiſtration of his Ordinances, to the end of the world, as wee have formerly ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It diſcovers men, notwithſtanding the <hi>high thoughts</hi> they have of themſelves, to be of a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſenſuall</hi> frame of ſpirit; that <hi>Thomas</hi>-like will not beleeve, nor give credit to the <hi>teſtimony of the Word,</hi> unleſſe they <hi>ſee,</hi> and have <hi>viſible and ſenſible ſignes and wonders wrought before them,</hi> and ſo to ſpeak truly, deſtroy the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and livelyneſſe of faith,</hi> which our Saviour placeth in this, that it acts and works moſt <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>genuinely,</hi> when it hath no <hi>externall and viſible ſigne</hi> to look on, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.29, 30. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. The <hi>Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites,</hi> and thoſe <hi>hard-hearted</hi> Jewes indeed, in our Saviours time, ſtood much upon ſignes and wonders, that ſo they might beleeve; but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our returnes them this anſwer, that <hi>an evill and adulterous generation ſeeketh after a ſigne, but there ſhall none be given them,</hi> that is, to <hi>profit them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.38, 39. And we may much feare, that all thoſe <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> that God hath of late <hi>wrought in England</hi> to recover us out of our old wayes, and to bring us to his own inſtituted wayes of worſhip, ſhall not profit ſuch kind of ſpirits, who walk more after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> then <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in the very <hi>things of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes men to place the power and authority of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the things of Gods houſe, in that which is <hi>fallible and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> as gifts of working Miracles are and may be <hi>in a falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> as we have ſhewed before: and if it were poſſible, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, the elect themſelves would be deceived by the workers of them, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. for there ſhall ariſe falſe chriſts and falſe prophets, and ſhall <hi>ſhew great ſignes and wonders,</hi> in ſo much that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as are carryed on in this way, are unavoidably brought to <hi>deny themſelves Beleevers;</hi> for if there be no converſion now for want of ſuch a Miniſtery as they talk of, then they exclude themſelves from the number of the faithfull, and proclaime to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114076:57"/> world that <hi>they are ſtrangers to the Promiſe</hi> and Common-wealth of Iſrael, being without God, and Chriſt, and hope in the world, and this (at length) ſome ſtick not to affirme, not onely <hi>denying worſhip,</hi> but <hi>Beleevers and Scripture</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, It not onely leaves upon them the guilt of curſed <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> and <hi>unkindneſſe</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, for what he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the Saints, and vouchſafed to them; and they (at leaſt wiſe ſome of them) have <hi>enjoyed,</hi> in <hi>the uſe of church-fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>ordinances,</hi> for I appeale to them and other of the Saints, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>ſweeteſt enjoyments from Chriſt have not been by the Spirit</hi> in theſe.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Heaven</hi> we all know is a <hi>high</hi> place, not only ſeparated from, but elevated farre above the earth: ſo are the viſible churches of Chriſt, though they be in the world, yet farre above the world, and therefore compared to a <hi>mountaine,</hi> and a City <hi>upon a hill, Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter altitudinem, Eſay</hi> 2.2, 3.30.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Heaven</hi> is a place of purity and holines, the inhabitants of it are all pure and holy, for no unrighteous perſon can enter into it, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. So the viſible churches of Chriſt are places of purity and holineſſe, no uncleane perſon is <hi>De jure, i.e.</hi> of right, to enter into this church-ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. neither is any that worketh abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be tollerated in it, but to be put away, and caſt out. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Heaven</hi> is a place of unſpeakeable ſweetnes, and joy, to thoſe that are in it, there being a Sea of boundleſſe and bottomleſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in which the Saints ſhall bathe themſelves to all eternity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> So in this viſible church-ſtate the Saints that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart, are filled and overcome <hi>oftentimes</hi> with the joyes of the Spirit, having fellowſhip with the Father, and his Son Ieſus Chriſt, in the pure and precious ordinances of his worſhip, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Heaven</hi> is a place of great and wonderfull dignity, honour &amp; glory, where the Inhabitants have all of them their crownes upon their heads, to ſet forth their excellent and high condition, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. ſo the members of this church-ſtate on earth, are perſons of great honour and dignity, though the world ſeeth it not, and therefore they are ſtyled Kings and Prieſts to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and they have crownes of gold on their heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.4. and 5.10. and they ſit on thrones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.5. having power committed to them, both of binding and looſing, opening and ſhutting the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19 by their officers.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Heaven</hi> is the place where God dwels, and doth more <hi>eſpecially</hi> make himſelfe known to the Saints and Angels: So here the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and churches of the Saints, are the places where the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, doth more eſpecially ſhine forth, and his mind is made known by his Spirit, as I have ſhewed in the 5.

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:114076:62"/>8. In the lower heavens are placed the <hi>Sunne, Moon, and Starres,</hi> to give light and influence to the earth, without which the earth would ſoon corrupt and grow inhabitable: So in the viſible chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, is placed the light of the truth, and glorious Miniſtery of the word, and other ſhining ordinances, and <hi>divine inſtitutions,</hi> without which the whole world of mankind, would live rather like <hi>Beaſts</hi> then <hi>men,</hi> and be in continuall danger of ſinking under the burthen of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The lower heavens are oftentimes <hi>darkned,</hi> with clouds, ſtormes, and tempeſts that are generated in the middle region of the aire, ſo that many times, neither <hi>Sunne, Moone, nor Starres,</hi> do appeare, but are, as if they were not, to our diſcerning, and yet they have their being notwithſtanding theſe clouds and ſtormes: So it is with the viſible churches of the Saints, they are ſo clouded many times with the tempeſts and ſtormes of perſecutions, &amp;c. that they ſcarce ſeem to be, having no glory, nor beauty, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally appeares to the eye of men, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

               <p>By all which we cleerly ſee, of what a ſpirituall frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution this true Goſpel Church-ſtate of Chriſts appointment is, but it is far otherwiſe with all other falſe Church ſtates that are not gathered according to Chriſts order and appointment; for they are made up of the world, cages of all uncleane birds, habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of devils, and all foule ſpirits, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. drunkards, ſwearers, lyars, Idolaters, Adulterers, perſecutors, and what not? are <hi>Church-members.</hi>

               <p>Touching the firſt, the embodying of the Saints together. For the better effecting of it, three things are to be done by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are to <hi>informe themſelves</hi> touching the right <hi>order</hi> of the Goſpell what <hi>it is,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> it was practiſed by the <hi>churches,</hi> in the dayes of the Apoſtles, before it was <hi>defloured</hi> and abuſed with the <hi>dreggs</hi> of mens inventions: The Saints are to obſerve <hi>the pattern in the Mount,</hi> (that is) they are to looke to the <hi>Primitive inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Chriſt, and obſerve them, and walke according to them, in all the worſhip of God: When <hi>Moſes</hi> was to build the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> he was to looke to the <hi>pattern</hi> that God gave him in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and he did ſo, and he was judged <hi>faithfull</hi> before the Lord for ſo doing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. and <hi>David</hi> after him, and other of the Servants of God, they diligently looked into the Booke of the Law, that they might know how to proceed in ſuch a work as this, as <hi>building the Temple,</hi> and thus Jeſus Chriſt, when the queſtion was put to him about divorce, he brings them to the firſt <hi>inſtitution:</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the buſines of the Supper of the Lord, he raiſeth them up to the conſideration of the firſt <hi>inſtitution,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. And ſo ſhould the godly in this way of becomming a Temple, and <hi>Houſe to God,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt: looke <hi>how</hi> and in what <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> it was done in the <hi>Premitive times;</hi> and there is great reaſon for it, 1. Becauſe as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod primum, optimum,</hi> that which <hi>is firſt is beſt.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Primitive order was left to be a <hi>pattern</hi> to all ſucceeding generations, till Jeſus Chriſt <hi>himſelfe</hi> do come. 3. Becauſe in ſo doing, we give a teſtimony of our honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114076:65"/> of Chriſt in following his commands. And laſtly, becauſe then we may expect his <hi>bleſſing</hi> on our endeavours: but on the contrary, we ſhall provoke him to anger, as they did of old, that tooke not the due and <hi>right order</hi> of bringing the Arke to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 15.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we have done ſo, then we are to ſit down and <hi>compare</hi> our ſelves in our <hi>preſent ſtations,</hi> with that firſt <hi>order</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and ſee how farre <hi>ſhort</hi> we have come of it, and then be <hi>aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> and <hi>bluſh,</hi> and be <hi>confounded</hi> before the Lord, for the neglect of our duty all this while, and beg <hi>pardon</hi> through Chriſt, as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> did, for thoſe that have eaten the Paſſeover <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then it was written, <hi>i. e.</hi> then God had <hi>inſtituted and ordained,</hi> 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 30 18, 19. and this is requiſite to ſuch a condition, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11, 12. and if they be aſhamed of all they have done, ſhew them the forme of the houſe, and the faſhion thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the godly have <hi>endeavoured</hi> this, then in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Lord of glory, they are to ſet upon the bringing of themſelves and all they take in hand about this worke, to that <hi>Primitive order.</hi>

Becauſe if the eſſentials of their firſt Baptiſme were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and loſt in their Antichriſtian adminiſtration, as Re-Sap. hold, but I deny, and have ſhewed to the contrary in the 4. Chap. then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the godly muſt altogether remaine without any Church-ſtate, becauſe there muſt be the ſame power to erect this ordinance anew, that firſt ordained it, and the ſame or the like officers to adminiſter it, as were before it was loſt, but neither Chriſt, nor any ſuch extraordinary officers are now on earth. And hence it is, that this doctrine and practice of the Re-baptizers, hath made ſo many to turne Seekers and Waiters, denying all Churches, Miniſtery and Ordinances, expecting when Chriſt or his Apoſtles will come to reſtore them to their primitive purity and rectitude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be a <hi>right manner</hi> of performing thoſe ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and meanes of worſhip, by thoſe that are qualified and called hereunto by Chriſt, and this muſt carefully be lookt unto, becauſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114076:67"/> the beſt ordinances may be ſpoiled by the evill handling and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them.</p>
               <p>Now the right manner of worſhipping God by thoſe that are to enter upon this Goſpel-order and Church-ſtate inſtituted by Chriſt, conſiſts in theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Owens</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Eſſay for Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>p.</hi> 60</note> voluntary union and knitting together in one. This is neceſſarily ſuppoſed, as I ſhewed before, Chap. 2. The godly muſt be formed into one body, or Church-ſociety, as in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, diſtinguiſhed from others. Now this is to be done by the Saints that are to embody theſe three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> or <hi>ſequeſter</hi> themſelves from the looſe and profane multitude among whom they live, having no <hi>more fellowſhip</hi> with them in <hi>ſpeciall</hi> ordinances, whiles they continue ſuch. This is expreſly commanded 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are <hi>voluntarily</hi> to give up themſelves to the Lord, and one another, as thoſe of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.15. to walk <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in all the ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is to be done in a <hi>mutuall conſent, covenant,</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">Some promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Owen ut ſupra.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as was the practice of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and was alſo <hi>prophecyed</hi> then, ſhould be done now in the dayes of the Goſpel, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.5. and is now practiced in the very Nationall Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> accordingly. Now if it be (as they take it) <hi>lawfull</hi> for a <hi>National Church</hi> to enter into ſuch a Covenant to walke with God, and one another, according as he ſhall make himſelfe knowne to them in his Word, I cannot ſee how it can be <hi>unlawfull</hi> for a <hi>particular Church</hi> thus to doe. And for this, <hi>Vide</hi> Maſter <hi>Burr. Heart Diviſ. p.</hi> 69.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there muſt be <hi>union,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>communion,</hi> that is, they muſt in the worſhip of God meet <hi>together</hi> joyntly, as <hi>members</hi> of one <hi>body, tarrying one for another,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be a <hi>ſweet harmony,</hi> conſent and agreement in the <hi>performance</hi> of the holy ordinances of Chriſt, labouring to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt to be of <hi>one heart</hi> and <hi>one mind,</hi> in executing all <hi>Church-affaires. Act.</hi> 2.1.41, 42. <hi>&amp; Act.</hi> 4.32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There muſt be a <hi>free, ready, willing,</hi> and <hi>cheerfull contributing</hi> of ſuch bleſſings, mercies, gifts and graces, <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>ſhirituall,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:114076:67"/> as Jeſus Chriſt hath beſtowed upon us, for the comfort and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the whole body thus united and joyned together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There muſt be a <hi>diligent care had</hi> and taken that things be <hi>ſo ordered,</hi> and ordinances be ſo performed, that Jeſus Chriſt do not <hi>ſuffer</hi> in his honour, nor the <hi>church</hi> in her happines &amp; welfare: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is done 1.

By being very <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>heavenly, meeke, and humble, lowly and loving</hi> in all our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings and performances, that Chriſt may have glory, and the Goſpell credit. 5.

               <p>And thus we have done with the firſt part of the Chapter, the Saints embodying, and how they are to do it. Now followes the ſecond part of the Chapter, and that is, what concernes their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> after <hi>embodying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this I ſhall endeavour to make out in five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be <hi>choice of their officers,</hi> as <hi>Paſtor, Teacher, Elder,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ires, and which may give them the right hand of fellowſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Are they not to be ordained by impoſition of hands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is no abſolute neceſſity of it, for we read no precept for it, and but little practiſe of it in ſuch caſes. In other caſes we do, but not in this. That of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. is no inſtitution of it, but only a practiſe of the Elders of the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. not <hi>of the officers of ſeverall churches, as it is now uſed.</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:114076:68"/> When that <hi>Matthias</hi> was choſen an Apoſtle in <hi>Judas</hi> roome, wee read only of his being numbred among the reſt of the Apoſtles. When they made Deacons for the poore, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. we read, after they had prayed, they laid their hands on them, I ſay after, but not before, or in the time they were praying, <hi>as the presbyterians in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do now,</hi> and whether that <hi>Timothy</hi> had hands laid on him in time of prayer, as it is now uſed in ordination of Miniſters, is more then any I ſuppoſe can determine: So that it ſeemes it was uſed rather in way of bleſſing of them, as Chriſt did the little childeren and others that were ſick, then ſetting them apart to the office they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to. And that of <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. doth not prove it as we have ſhewed before. And Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe never uſed it, when he ſent forth his Diſciples to preach: nor gave it in commiſſion to his Apoſtles that they ſhould do it; nor have they enjoyned ſuch a thing. And therefore as <hi>Polanus, Tilenus, Calvin,</hi> &amp; other great Divines ſay, it is a matter indifferent, not abſolutely neceſſary &amp; eſſential to an officers calling, as many ſuppoſe: And tis no more then what the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath alſo declared heretofore. But to cleare this buſines fully, there is a learned Treatiſe put forth lately, wherein the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reformed churches, and Proteſtant Divines is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exactly, about this point, ſo that I need not to ſpeake further of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The preſervation of their unity, for unity among bretheren in church-fellowſhip, is very lovely, pleaſant, and full of beauty, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1, 2. <hi>O quam bonum &amp; jucundum, &amp;c.</hi> and there is no one duty more preſt on the Saints in church-fellowſhip then this of unity, as the Scriptures do abundantly teſtify, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. and 2.3, 4, 5. And if we looke no further then to the evill and ſad effects which the contrary doth produce, <hi>viz. Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> in Churches: The truth both of the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> hereof will eaſily appeare. And therefore for this <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpoſe,</hi> that the godly in this <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the Goſpell, may live together in <hi>unity</hi> and brotherly love, they are to ſtudy <hi>ſelf-denyall, humility, patience, long-ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> towards one another, <hi>putting on bowels of mercy, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us, Epheſ</hi> 4. <hi>ult. and Col.</hi> 3.12. For this, ſee more in that excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Heart Diviſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:114076:68"/>3. They are to ſtudy the preſervation of <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holines,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; this in a ſpeciall manner is to be looked after: what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to <hi>Timothy</hi> in particular, we may ſay to them in <hi>church-fellowſhip, keepe your ſelves pure:</hi> and the reaſons are theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that <hi>purity</hi> is the <hi>beauty</hi> of a <hi>church, Pſal.</hi> 93. <hi>ult.</hi> as nothing doth more <hi>darken</hi> and obſcrue a church then <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more adorn and beautifie a church then holines and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe that <hi>purity</hi> is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of a church: We never read of any churches that have miſcarried, but firſt it came from <hi>ſuffering</hi> themſelves to be <hi>polluted</hi> and <hi>defiled,</hi> either in <hi>opinion</hi> or <hi>practiſe:</hi> The <hi>Veſtall Virgins</hi> we read could not be <hi>overcome</hi> before they were <hi>defloured,</hi> and therefore the Emperour firſt cauſed them to be defiled, &amp; then deſtroyes them: So here therefore let the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are as <hi>Virgins</hi> eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preſerve their <hi>purity,</hi> and then they need not feare their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and to this purpoſe let them be carefull to obſerve and practiſe theſe following directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let every <hi>particular</hi> member labour to keepe their own <hi>veſſels</hi> pure, looke <hi>narrowly</hi> to his own heart and wayes, and keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from his own iniquity, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them ſtudy <hi>faithfullnes</hi> one towards another in their <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> watching over one another, for the good of the whole, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let thoſe whom it concernes looke <hi>narrowly</hi> to the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of members, not looking to, nor <hi>labouring after multitude,</hi> ſo much as cleannes and purity: a <hi>little church with great godlines, is farre to be preferred before a great church (I meane for number) and ſmal purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let there be care taken that no root <hi>of bitternes</hi> be ſuffered to ſpring up to the <hi>defiling</hi> of any, or if it appeare, let it be in a ſpirit of love and meekenes ſuppreſſed <hi>timely:</hi> twas the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Corinths</hi> fault that they did not mourne for the <hi>inceſtuous perſons</hi> fact, and put him from amongſt them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2, 6, 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let them have a watchfull eye to all <hi>church adminiſtrations,</hi> that they be done <hi>according to the rule of the word,</hi> and not after the wiſdome of the <hi>fleſh.</hi>
               </p>

                     </gap>mpediment.</note>THe firſt impediment that ſtands in their way is this, <hi>That there are many learned and godly Miniſters, as well as private chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that both write and ſpeak againſt this way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to remove this impediment, I ſhall deſire the godly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether</hi> all thoſe are <hi>truly godly,</hi> that make a <hi>profeſſion</hi> of godlineſſe, even amongſt them that goe for <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>guides</hi> to others. Is not the contrary too true? have not too too many the <hi>forme</hi> of godlineſſe, denying the power of it? according to that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. walking up and down in <hi>ſheeps clothing,</hi> but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> as Jeſus Chriſt ſpake of the proud and lofty Phariſees, and other falſe Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. and doe not their actions both <hi>abroad</hi> and at <hi>home,</hi> ſpeak out aloud the truth hereof? So that the <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>pens</hi> of ſuch men againſt this way of the Lord, whether <hi>Miniſters</hi> or others, are no <hi>ſlander,</hi> but are rather to be lookt upon as the diſcovery of the <hi>rottennes</hi> of their own hearts, and the <hi>fruit</hi> of thoſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>that walk in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and run greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam, <hi>for reward, and ſhall periſh in the gain-ſaying of</hi> Korah, <hi>Iude</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, grant they are ſuch Miniſters and Chriſtians, that is, <hi>truly godly,</hi> holding forth the power of godlineſſe in their walking, that ſpeak againſt this <hi>order</hi> of the Goſpel, and way of the Lord. Yet I hope tis not an <hi>impoſſible thing</hi> even for ſuch men to erre, and be drawne aſide <hi>ſome times,</hi> in <hi>ſome things,</hi> to doe that which is <hi>unworthy</hi> their <hi>high and holy calling.</hi> Is it any <hi>new thing</hi> to heare of the godly themſelves making oppoſition againſt Chriſt, even in the greateſt matters that concerne his glory? let us looke upon that place of the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3. where we may ſee, that when Chriſt ſhall come <hi>to purge and reforme his Temple,</hi> he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114076:70"/> ſhall meet with <hi>oppoſition</hi> from a generation of people, which are not of the <hi>vileſt and baſeſt ſort,</hi> but of the <hi>precious,</hi> ſuch as are like to gold and ſilver: The ſonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> Preachers, as well as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians: and theſe ſhall ſcarce endure his comming, but ſhall make ſome kind of reſiſtance. And are there not abundant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for this? did not <hi>Peter oppoſe</hi> Chriſt himſelfe in the worke of <hi>Redemption,</hi> inſomuch that Chriſt called him <hi>Sathan</hi> for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.22, 23. and told him to his face, that he did not ſavour the things of God? and yet <hi>Peter</hi> I hope will not be denyed to be truly godly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did not the devout women many times riſe up (by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Jewes) againſt the <hi>Apoſtles and brethren</hi> where they came to preach, and practice contrary to the <hi>Iewiſh cuſtomes,</hi> in ſetting up, and planting this Goſpel Church-ſtate?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have we not experience of many godly men, <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> in the late times of the Prelates, that did ſide with the Biſhops, againſt their godly brethren, the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> that wrote againſt the Ceremonies, Service-book, and Hierarchicall Government, and preſt thoſe <hi>very things</hi> at that time, that now theſe men practice, which ſpeak evill of what we now ſtir up the godly unto? Now if it be ſo, then it is not ſo much to be wondred, that godly men have their hands, and tongues, and pens againſt this way of the Goſpel, which we conceive to be a ſtep or two higher for purity, and nearer to the will and mind of Chriſt, and practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, then what is now on foot. The beſt men are <hi>men,</hi> &amp; ſo have their <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> as well as others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is to be conſidered, that not <hi>all</hi> men, no not <hi>godly men</hi> are enlightned equally <hi>alike</hi> in the <hi>myſteries</hi> of the Goſpel. But as the wind blows when and where it liſteth, ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> by his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> gives light when and where he pleaſeth. Gifts of wiſdome and underſtanding in the myſteries of godlineſſe are Gods <hi>peculiar</hi> goods, (as one ſaith well) and he may give his <hi>owne</hi> where hee liſteth; neither muſt our eye be evill becauſe his is good. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as the proverb is) <hi>the greateſt clarks are not the wiſeſt men,</hi> no not in leſſer and petty things of this life. Now if they are to ſeek in theſe things many times, then much more may they be to ſeeke in the <hi>great things</hi> of Chriſts Kingdome, and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives thankes to his Father, that he had <hi>hid theſe myſteries
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114076:71"/> from the wiſe and learned, and revealed them to babes,</hi> Matth. 11.26, 27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though there are many godly, both Preachers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are againſt it; Yet it <hi>cannot be denyed,</hi> but there are alſo <hi>multitudes</hi> of godly <hi>of all ſorts</hi> and callings in the <hi>Magiſtracy, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, practice of Law, Phyſick,</hi> in <hi>Counſels,</hi> and <hi>Armies,</hi> both in City, and Country, that are for it. And not onely in this City and Country, but forraigne countries, and the number increaſeth daily, and is like more and more to increaſe, till it have prevailed againſt all other, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 2 44. intimates.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, We muſt know, that the godly are in a way of <hi>learning</hi> ſtill more and more, both Miniſters and others, they are not come to that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and top of knowledge, as to proceed no farther, for we all know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. So that though they are <hi>darke in this point,</hi> this yeere, yet tis poſſible the <hi>next yeere</hi> they may be inlightned. Seven yeeres ſince, many godly <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were for <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> for the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>Service-book;</hi> what <hi>Sermons</hi> were preached, what <hi>books</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the defence of them, and againſt thoſe that oppoſed them? how were the <hi>Biſhops</hi> honoured and reverenced, bowed to, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and ſtood for, and that with great eagerneſſe and violence, ſo that thoſe that were againſt them, were deeply cenſured by their brethren? but now it is otherwiſe; and why ſo? but becauſe their judgement is changed, and men ſay, that God hath opened their eyes, and convinced them of the evill of thoſe things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw not; and tis well if it be ſo: and not <hi>ſimply a diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe evils from the Parliaments removing of them,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the contrary,</hi> which is much to be feared, and as ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt without bluſhing, ſaying, what they now doe in renouncing Epiſcopall Government, leaving the Service-book and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and proceeding according to the order and forme of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and Government eſtabliſhed, they <hi>doe by Law,</hi> in obedience and ſubjection to the Parliament that requires it in their Ordinance affixed to the Directory, <hi>not out of any judgement of the evill they have formerly lived in, whilſt they uſed that way of falſe worſhip,</hi> or out of any more love to this new government, and order of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to the Directory. But ſuppoſe the beſt, that what men now doe is from the Lords mercifull enlightning of them, to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114076:71"/> ſee into the evill of their old and former <hi>abominations,</hi> they yeelded to, and ſo became guilty of, before the Lord; will it not therefore follow, that there is a <hi>poſſibility</hi> before ſeven yeeres come about againe, they may <hi>ſee further</hi> into this myſterie of the Goſpel, and ſo diſcover the <hi>unſoundneſſe</hi> of their preſent ſtanding in the Pariſh Churches, as they are conſtituted and receive their life and being from the Civill Lawes of the Land? The Aire is enlightned by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> not all at once, and ſo are the Saints. So that I ſay ſo long as the godly themſelves are in a way of learning and going from <hi>one ſtep</hi> to another in <hi>wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> as <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.18. men ſhould take heed, how they make peremptory concluſions againſt this way of the Lord, and <hi>ſpeak evill of the things they know not,</hi> leſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>(the juſtifier of his wayes and people)</hi> make them to <hi>eate the words they have ſpoken,</hi> and then they be forc'd (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes did) to write Books of <hi>Recantation,</hi> and have as little <hi>credit,</hi> as <hi>comfort</hi> in what they have done this way.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the <hi>truth</hi> were knowne, and men would ſpeak out <hi>all</hi> is in their hearts, it is not to be doubted but a chiefe ground of many mens crying downe this way of the Lord, and thoſe that walke in it, is no other, but their <hi>envy</hi> at thoſe (eſpecially <hi>young ones</hi>) to whom the <hi>Lord</hi> hath in theſe laſt dayes imparted and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greater <hi>meaſures</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and larger <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of the myſterie of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> according to the promiſe, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. wherein young men ſhall have the priority of old. Becauſe the Lord is good, therefore their eye is evill, as Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. that took offence at his kindneſſe to thoſe that came into the vineyard after them, and wrought but an houre. But this is an evill frame of heart, and cleane contrary to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that wiſht that all the Lords people were Prophets, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.29.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But laſtly, doth not this <hi>generality</hi> of oppoſition againſt this way alledged, conclude and evidence the truth and goodnes of it, eſpecially when ſuch oppoſition tends to the increaſe and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, and that alſo amongſt the moſt pious and ſpiritualleſt Beleevers? What though the Authors in the<note n="*" place="margin">D. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> the Captain of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Army, as he ſtyles himſelfe M. <hi>Prinne.</hi> M. <hi>Edwards.</hi> M. <hi>Baily.</hi> M. <hi>Vicars.</hi>
                  </note> Marg. (as men not having yet learned, or elſe not regarding what Chriſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures requires of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>James</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.) have cryed it downe, as the moſt pernicious way; yet all the <hi>dirt</hi> they have throwne in the <hi>face</hi> of it, cannot
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114076:72"/> make the <hi>Saints</hi> out of love with it. In the dayes of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe that embraced the doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and right way of worſhipping God, were <hi>generally condemned</hi> and ſpoken againſt, as <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Heretiques, Act.</hi> 14.5, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 28 22. yet that could not <hi>hinder</hi> the prevailing of it, being it was of God. So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the <hi>worſt</hi> that men can doe, hinder it now; but maugre all the <hi>powers</hi> of hell, and the world that oppoſe it, it ſhall take place, for Chriſt muſt reigne.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Impediment. </seg>2</label> 2. The ſecond impediment that lies in the way of divers godly perſons is this, <hi>That ſalvation may be had, in that preſent church-ſtate they for the preſent are, and therefore judge it a nee, leſſe thing to come into any other Church-ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſuch I ſhall commend theſe few conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though it be granted as a truth, (which cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that its <hi>poſſible for men to be ſaved, though they never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a right viſible Church-ſtate and order,</hi> becauſe <hi>faith and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is not ſo tyed <hi>to the viſible church, as that there is no</hi> partaking thereof out of it. And though it be true alſo, that <hi>converſion</hi> may be obtained, and is, in many of the <hi>Pariſh Aſſemblies,</hi> as <hi>we know by experience,</hi> yet how <hi>unkindly</hi> do ſuch Chriſtians deale with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that ſhall as the <hi>Head and King of his church,</hi> appoint &amp; ordaine a <hi>holy order</hi> for his Saints to obſerve, in their ſerving and worſhipping of God, and yet they ſhall refuſe to ſubmit thereunto, is it not a diſparagement to the wiſdome of the Lord Jeſus, that hath thus ordained a <hi>church order</hi> for his Saints to walke in, and yet they ſhall count it a needleſſe thing?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such ſhould conſider, whether the <hi>truth of grace,</hi> doth not teach them to have reſpect to the <hi>whole revealed will</hi> of God; and not to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with themſelves in the neglect of obedience to any, the leaſt part of it; and if ſo, then how dangerous is it for them to ſit downe and content themſelves in their preſent diſordered ſtation, without comming out of it to <hi>Sion,</hi> as Chriſt commandeth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 52.11. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is not this an argument of a low Spirit, exceeding <hi>earthly</hi> &amp; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat have greatly longed after, and mourned with much bitternes when they have been deprived of the enjoyment of God in his ordinances, as <hi>David,</hi> and others? <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth not this plainly <hi>diſcover</hi> to the world, that ſuch men are to this day marvellous ignorant of this great myſtery of the Goſpel? they ſee not the luſtre and beauty that ſhines forth in the viſible <hi>Churches</hi> of the Saints, a right and true communion of Saints, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fellowſhip with Chriſt in his own ordinances, is <hi>a meere rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a paradox</hi> to them, the <hi>comly order</hi> and ſweet <hi>harmony of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs Tents,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels Tabernacles</hi> is not diſcerned by them, though a <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelfe was greatly affected therewith. Oh when ſhall this darkenes be removed!</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would faine know whether ſuch poore ſoules are not great <hi>enemies</hi> to their own happines, and hinderers of their own welfare. For firſt, have they not many precious <hi>Talents, Gifts, and Graces,</hi> beſtowed upon them, for which they ſhall be accountable to Chriſt one day, which now are as it were put under a Buſhel, &amp; lye aſleep, and of no uſe or benefit to themſelves or others? all which, if they were once come into a ſociety of faithfull and zealous Saints, would be occaſioned frequently to be brought forth, and improved to the glory of God, the benefit of others, and their own great encreaſe and advantage. Secondly, are they not ſubject to many wanderings, and out-goings from God, and ſo have need of ſome to <hi>watch</hi> over their precious ſoules, to prevent (as it is poſſible) ſuch <hi>ſwervings</hi> from Chriſt, by their wholſome and <hi>gentle admonitions, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reproofes,</hi> which priviledge they might enjoy if they were in this order of the Goſpell, but now are deprived of? Thirdly, are they not many times ſo overtaken through the <hi>ſubtilty</hi> of Sathan, &amp; <hi>deceitfullnes</hi> of ſin, that they not only fall into ſinne, but there <hi>lye and continue</hi> in their back-ſliding, and have none to <hi>looke after</hi> them to <hi>reſtore</hi> them againe, to ſet their <hi>broken bones</hi> in joynt again: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they were in this way of the Lord the Goſpell requires, how <hi>ſweetly</hi> might they be recovered, according to the injunction of the Apoſtle to the Church of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 6.1. And therefore doubtleſſe thoſe men that thus reaſon as before, that its no great matter to come into any other church-ſtate then they are, are no ſmall enemies to their own good.</p>

               <p>A fourth hindrance in their way, is, <hi>That they look upon this way, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now to remove this, I anſwer in a word, there is a two-fold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration the Scripture ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

I hope we ſhall uſe,</hi> (I am perſwaded we ought not) <hi>Antichriſts broom to ſweep Chriſts houſe with, or his weapons to fight againſt errours with.

               <p n="4">4. Is not ſuch a courſe as this, againſt the golden Rule of <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

So here: And therefore the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo farre from enforcing <hi>mens conſciences,</hi> as that they permit them <hi>to uſe their conſciences, and practiſe their judgements, though different from them.</hi> And though in <hi>Spain</hi> the Proteſtants are prohibited the practiſe of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the <hi>Spaniard</hi> doth not violently compell men to alter their minds, and to be of their Religion: Temptations by way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or gifts, &amp;c. they may lay before men, but not outward wayes of violence.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:114076:81"/>6. Beſides all this, doth not this courſe directly croſſe the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and practiſe of Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> who bids us to <hi>love one another, as he hath loved us? Ioh.</hi> 13.14. that is, for quality, and not for equality or quantity and degree: Now its as cleare as the Sun at noone day, that Chriſt loved all that believe in him, one as well as another, though they <hi>differ one from another</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and are not of the ſame ſtature and tallnes, in all things he hath commanded, ſo long as they hold the Head; yea, though they differ from himſelfe in many things revealed, and miſtake and miſ-underſtand him in many things, (as who doth not) yet ſtill he loves them, and beares with their weakeneſſes, and fellowſhip with them by his Spirit, whileſt their hearts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with him for the main; and the ſame he requires of the Saints one toward another, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.2, 3.13.32. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12.13, 14. not that they ſhould proceed in a bitter manner, to cut off, and caſt one another over board.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To take this courſe with men that differ from us in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is it not the High-way to make more <hi>hypocrites,</hi> then ſound Chriſtians, and ſo to introduce a profeſſion of Religion, no way pleaſing to God, as all forced profeſſion is? for when men become Proſelites more for feare, then conſcience, there is not only a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, in what they do, but a readineſſe (when an oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is preſented) to returne to their old and former errours, for outward violence is of this nature, that it rather <hi>reſtraines</hi> then <hi>changeth,</hi> and of this there hath been abundant wofull experience in all ages, and which of the two is worſt, heretiques or hypocrites, to maintain an errour, or counterfeit the truth, is not eaſily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And doth not this courſe bring people to be more in love with errours then before? the reaſon is, becauſe People conceive thoſe errours ſo perſecuted, are the truth <hi>of God,</hi> in regard that Jeſus Chriſt hath fore-told that perſecution ſhould attend the truth, and thoſe that are embracers and profeſſors of it: now when men (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the <hi>weake</hi>) ſhall ſee that ſuch and ſuch perſons <hi>(otherwiſe quiet and peaceable in the Land, only differing from others in their judgements)</hi> ſhall be violently oppoſed, for what they hold, &amp; have cruell meanes uſed to take them off from what they conceive is the truth, they preſently conclude, this muſt needs be the very way of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114076:82"/> God, and ſo there is more hurt a thouſond times done, then good by ſuch violent wayes of compulſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="2">2. Now for the ſecond ſort of perſons, that give to <hi>Miniſters</hi> met together in a <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> an abſolute power of impoſing their concluſions and determinations on the conſciences of people in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or whole Churches in generall, to be obeyed neceſſarily without refuſing; I ſhall propoſe theſe few things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this doth not croſſe that command of Chriſt by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good:</hi> now to what purpoſe is this command, if I am <hi>neceſſitated</hi> to yeeld to anothers impoſition the tryall here ſpoken of reſpects the <hi>mind and underſtanding,</hi> as all wiſe men know, but how can he <hi>exerciſe</hi> his mind this way, that is <hi>tyed and bound up</hi> by anothers vote and impoſition to obey? Seeing by this meanes he muſt yeeld without any further enquiry or ſearch into the thing commanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be according to the mind of Chriſt, or not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether this doth not make the <hi>liberty of the Saints leſſe now</hi> in theſe dayes, then in the dayes of the Apoſtles, when we find the <hi>Bereans</hi> had liberty, firſt to examine the Apoſtles doctrine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>I ſay themſelves,</hi> before they ſubmitted and ſubjected their conſciences to the obedience of it; and they are commended for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. whereas now, its counted a matter of diſobedience, and faction, for any the moſt holieſt, and ſoundeſt in the fayth, ſo much as to queſtion and enquire, whether what an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Claſſis</hi> doth impoſe on them, as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be obeyed, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures, to Chriſts will, and not their own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether ſuch a kind of Impoſition, doth not bring ſuch <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in their Synods and Claſſis, under the guilt and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of being <hi>Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> in exerciſing authority, power, and dominion <hi>over the faith of their bretheren,</hi> contrary to

               <p n="4">4. Whether this practiſe of ſuch Miniſters doth not bring into the <hi>Churches</hi> of Chriſt, that Popiſh doctrine and practiſe of <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith,</hi> for if I muſt take all for granted <hi>to be true,</hi> that ſuch men command obedience unto, without any further enquiry, then my <hi>faith</hi> is not an expl cite, but a meere <hi>implicite</hi> faith, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my <hi>obedience blind,</hi> and ſo abominable: which ſome more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Presbyterians themſelves, in their Sermons, diſpute ſtrongly againſt; as M. <hi>Hill</hi> in his Sermon called <hi>the good old way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether this be not for Miniſters to challenge that power, which Jeſus Chriſt <hi>never called them unto,</hi> nor beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Did not the Apoſtles practiſe it, in that Synod?</hi> Act. 15.</p>

Therefore Miniſters may now do it, a meere <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> Unleſſe that ordinary Miniſters now could expect the ſame <hi>infallible guidance</hi> of the Spirit, as the Apoſtles could: They could ſay without the leaſt <hi>haeſitancy</hi> or doubting, <hi>It ſeemeth good to the holy Ghoſt and to us:</hi> And can any Aſſembly or Synod of Miniſters do ſo now? can they ſay certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Apoſtles, that thoſe Synodicall and claſſicall <hi>conſtitutions,</hi> they impoſe with ſuch authority, on the conſciences of others, to obey and practiſe, are according to the true mind and meaning of Chriſt? If they can produce any <hi>warrant</hi> for it, let them; if they cannot, why do they beare the People of the Kingdome in hand, that it is in their power <hi>alone,</hi> without the <hi>Peoples conſent,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and impoſe as they (by themſelves alone) conceive to be right?
